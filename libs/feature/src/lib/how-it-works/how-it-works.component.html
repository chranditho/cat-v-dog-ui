<h1>How it works</h1>
<p>
  This is a simple image classifier that uses a pre-trained model to classify images as either a cat or a dog.
</p>
<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>
  The dataset used to train the model consists of 25,000 images of cats and dogs.
  10% of the images were used for validation, and 90% were used for training.
  The dataset is available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data">Kaggle</a>.
</p>
<h2>Model</h2>
<p>
  The model used is a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model with weights from ImageNet.
  The model was fine-tuned on the dataset using transfer learning.
</p>
<h2>Training</h2>
<p>
  The model was trained using TensorFlow and Keras.
  The model was trained for 30 epochs with a batch size of around 780.
  The model was compiled using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001.

<p>
  The code above shows the model architecture used for training.
  The model consists of several convolutional layers followed by max pooling layers.
  The model ends with a dense layer with a sigmoid activation function.
</p>
<h4>Explaining the Layers</h4>
<p>
  The first layer is an input layer that takes an image of size 224x224 pixels with 3 color channels.
  The subsequent layers are convolutional layers that learn features from the input image.
  The max pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
  The dense layers at the end of the model perform classification based on the learned features.
